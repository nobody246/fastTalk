# fastTalk
A simple multi-speech-synthesis-compatible user interface, to make speech synthesis commence sooner than 
the completion of the sentence.

A simple script that layers over one of any of the multiple command line accessible speech synthesis engines on Linux, 
just configure the software and set the selected-command variable in conf.scm.
Instead of waiting for a sentence to be input entirely, it speaks word by word, making the response time quicker, 
and sounding slightly more natural in conversation.

It also allows one to add abbreviations for words (as defined in abbr.scm).

Use this however you want (if anyone would even want to..), I'm not responsible for anything.
